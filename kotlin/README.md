# Kotlin Interview Questions And Answers

-   **lateinit vs lazy?**<br/>
    A) lateinit can be used for var properties where Kotlin promises the compiler that the variable will be initialized later failure of which will lead to exception.
    lazy can only be used for val properties. It will be initialized during the first call where the value will be stored in a cache so that another call to the same variable will serve the value stored in cache.

    In Kotlin also we can use .equals method but it is recommended to use == because Kotlin internally converts a==b, for example, to the following code:
```java
    a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null)
```
